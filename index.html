<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
  HTML is a type of code language used for creating web pages which ultimately
  tells the browser how to display the content that is processed. It consists of
  elements and codes that allow for creating web pages and designs. These tags
  and code words then help the browser display the content that they want to
  create.

  A reason why I took this class is because it will give me early exposure to
  what college classes will be like and was an option I could take to fulfill
  graduation requirements. Another reason why I took this class is for a new
  experience and trying something that I might end up liking after doing it. I
  think this class overall will help my time management and how to use
  technology better which can help me in a variety a ways in life.
